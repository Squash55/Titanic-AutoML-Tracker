    ### 🧠 What This Is

    The **DAIVID App Maturity Scorecard** tracks the evolution of your data science platform across core domains that drive value, credibility, and readiness for broader impact.

    Each phase is scored based on current capabilities. Use this to guide roadmap priorities, demo strengths to stakeholders, and silently monitor acquisition posture.
