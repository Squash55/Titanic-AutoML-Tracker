        questions[1]: "Smart Answer: Yes, females have significantly higher survival rates, and models often learn this bias early.",
        questions[2]: "Smart Answer: Models typically struggle with middle-age males in 3rd class with lower fares â€” prediction uncertainty is highest here.",
        questions[3]: "Smart Answer: If training accuracy is high but test accuracy drops, overfitting is likely. Compare those scores.",
        questions[4]: "Smart Answer: Consider feature engineering (e.g., family size), scaling Fare, and trying ensemble methods like XGBoost."
